//by default statements in js are executed sequentially i.e from top to bottom

conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression (condition) is true.

repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as or until a certain expression or condition is true.

Types of conditions in js:
-if
-if else
-if else if else
-switch (it is an alternate for if else if conditions)
-ternary operator


syntax example of switch:

                    let weather = 'cloudy'
                    switch (weather) {
                    case 'rainy':
                        console.log('You need a rain coat.')
                        break
                    case 'cloudy':
                        console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
                        break
                    case 'sunny':
                        console.log('Go out freely.')
                        break
                    default:
                        console.log(' No need for rain coat.')
                    }

                    // Switch More Examples
                    let dayUserInput = prompt('What day is today ?')
                    let day = dayUserInput.toLowerCase()

                    switch (day) {
                    case 'monday':
                        console.log('Today is Monday')
                        break
                    case 'tuesday':
                        console.log('Today is Tuesday')
                        break
                    case 'wednesday':
                        console.log('Today is Wednesday')
                        break
                    case 'thursday':
                        console.log('Today is Thursday')
                        break
                    case 'friday':
                        console.log('Today is Friday')
                        break
                    case 'saturday':
                        console.log('Today is Saturday')
                        break
                    case 'sunday':
                        console.log('Today is Sunday')
                        break
                    default:
                        console.log('It is not a week day.')
                    }


Ternary operators syntax example:

                    let isRaining = true
                    isRaining
                    ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
                    : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
