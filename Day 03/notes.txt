Boolean Values

let isLightOn = true
let isRaining = false
let isHungry = false
let isMarried = true
let truValue = 4 > 3    // true
let falseValue = 4 < 3  // false

//We agreed that boolean values are either true or false.

Truthy values

    All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero
    All strings are truthy except an empty string ('')
    The boolean true

Falsy values

    0
    0n
    null
    undefined
    NaN
    the boolean false
    '', "", ``, empty string

    undefined vs null
    undefined var or undefined in general means that the var is not assigned a value yet. if a function is not returning the value, it will be undefined.
    while, null simply means no value. 

Operators

1. (=) Assignment Operators: it is used to assign values to variables.

different combos:
=
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
**=

//** is exponention Operator and it is same as Math.pow()

2. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators.

Addition(+): a + b
Subtraction(-): a - b
Multiplication(*): a * b
Division(/): a / b (gives remainder)
Modulus(%): a % b
Exponential(**): a ** b

3. Comparison Operators
//note : these Comparison operators will always yeild or return a boolean value, ie true or false.

== (Equal in value only: Equivalent),  x==y
=== (Equal in both value and data type: Exactly equal),  x===y
!= (Not equal), x!=y
> (greater than), x>y
< (less than), x<y
>= (greater than or equal to), x>=y
<= (less than or equal to), x<=y

//Logical operators.
Three commonly used Logical Operators
1. && (AND operator) (all the conditions must be satisfied then it will be true otherwise false) 
2. || (OR Operator) (atleast one condition is satisfied then it will be true otherwise false)
3. ! (Negation Operator) : this will negate true to false & false to true. (kinda like opposite operator)

//Increment Operators
1. Increment Operators (to increase a value stored in a var)
    a. Pre-Increment (not used that much) (increments the value first)
        let count = 0
        console.log(++count)        // 1 
        console.log(count)          // 1

    b. Post-Increment
        let count = 0
        console.log(count++)        // 0
        console.log(count)          // 1

//Decrement Operators
2. Decrement Operators (to decrease a value stored in a var)
    a. Pre-Decrement (not used that much) (increments the value first)
        let count = 0
        console.log(++count)        // -1 
        console.log(count)          // -1

    b. Post-Decrement
        let count = 0
        console.log(count++)        // 0
        console.log(count)          // -1

3. Ternary  Operators
   Ternary operator allows to write a condition. Kinda like if-else
Example: 
        let isRaining = true
        isRaining
        ? console.log('You need a rain coat.') //if its true
        : console.log('No need for a rain coat.') //else (if its fault)

        isRaining = false
        isRaining
        ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
        : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')


        let number = 5
        number > 0
        ? console.log(`${number} is a positive number`)
        : console.log(`${number} is a negative number`)
        number = -5

        number > 0
        ? console.log(`${number} is a positive number`)
        : console.log(`${number} is a negative number`)


alert(): for displaying an alet :> alert("elloo");
prompt(): for taking input from the user (you can store the input in a var).
eg: var usrAge = prompt("whats yo age");

confirm(): 
The confirm() method displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with an OK and a Cancel button. A confirm box is often used to ask permission from a user to execute something. Window confirm() takes a string as an argument. Clicking the OK yields true value, whereas clicking the Cancel button yields false value.

const agree = confirm('Are you sure you like to delete? ')
console.log(agree) // result will be true or false based on what you click on the dialog box


//continue from date object.
