Boolean Values

let isLightOn = true
let isRaining = false
let isHungry = false
let isMarried = true
let truValue = 4 > 3    // true
let falseValue = 4 < 3  // false

//We agreed that boolean values are either true or false.

Truthy values

    All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero
    All strings are truthy except an empty string ('')
    The boolean true

Falsy values

    0
    0n
    null
    undefined
    NaN
    the boolean false
    '', "", ``, empty string

    undefined vs null
    undefined var or undefined in general means that the var is not assigned a value yet. if a function is not returning the value, it will be undefined.
    while, null simply means no value. 

Operators

1. (=) Assignment Operators: it is used to assign values to variables.

different combos:
=
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
**=

//** is exponention Operator and it is same as Math.pow()

2. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators.

Addition(+): a + b
Subtraction(-): a - b
Multiplication(*): a * b
Division(/): a / b (gives remainder)
Modulus(%): a % b
Exponential(**): a ** b

3. Comparison Operators
//note : these Comparison operators will always yeild or return a boolean value, ie true or false.

== (Equal in value only: Equivalent),  x==y
=== (Equal in both value and data type: Exactly equal),  x===y
!= (Not equal), x!=y
> (greater than), x>y
< (less than), x<y
>= (greater than or equal to), x>=y
<= (less than or equal to), x<=y

//resume from Logical operators.
