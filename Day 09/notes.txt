Higher order function

higher order functions are simply functions which either take other function as a parameter or return a function as a value.

Note: The function passed as a parameter is called callback.


*********************************************************************************
// SETTING TIME
// In JavaScript we can execute some activities in a certain interval of time or we can schedule(wait) for some time to execute some activities.


// There are two properties for setting time
//1. setInterval  //interval means the period of time marked off by or between two events, instants, etc

//2. setTimeout //scheduling or waiting for sometime and then do something

//Setting Interval using a setInterval function
// In JavaScript, we use setInterval higher order function to do some activity continuously with in some interval of time. The setInterval global method take a callback function and a duration as a parameter. The duration is in milliseconds and the callback will be always called in that interval of time.

Functional Programming
Instead of writing regular loop, latest version of JavaScript introduced lots of built in methods which can help us to solve complicated problems.

Builtin methods which take callback function 
-forEach
-map
-filter
-reduce
-find
-every
-some
-sort
