Variable declaration (from best to worst). (totally depends what you are declaring).
1. const (mostly and preferably used for declaring objects (cuz then its type cannot be changed) )
2. let (mostly used for strings, nums, etc.) (it is prefered to use cuz it cannot be re-declared, and it cannot set to be undefined, it will force you to define it.)
3. var (also used for strings, nums and other data types, however it can be redeclared and also can be left undefined).
